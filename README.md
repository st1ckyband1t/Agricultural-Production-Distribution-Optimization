# Agricultural-Production-Distribution-Optimization

AgriSeeds operates multiple facilities that produce different crop hybrids and distribute them to various regions.

The goal is to minimize the total production and transportation costs while ensuring demand is met and facility capacities are not exceeded.

This is solved as a linear optimization problem using GurobiPy, determining the optimal number of crop bags produced and shipped from each facility to each region.
